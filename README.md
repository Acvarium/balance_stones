# balance_stones
The Balance Stones simple 2D game where you have to build a tower using as many block, as possible.  
On desktop you can use your mouse to place randomly-sized blocks on top of each other and make sure the tower doesn't fall apart. 
On mobile devices you have extra possibility to change direction of in-game gravity by rotating the device in hands.
